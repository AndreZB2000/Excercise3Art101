<h1> Peppino's Demo </h1>

<p>  This is Peppino Spaghetti, and he has run into a cheeseslime that's blocking his way. What will Peppino do to fix this? <br>

<p>
    This piece involves animating assets to tell a narrative  <br>    
            The piece works because Peppino is parenting the slime in the code
            It could be better because there arent many building blocks that compose it <br>
